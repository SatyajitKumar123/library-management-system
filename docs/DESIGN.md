# Design Documentation

## Database Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Conducted stakeholder interviews
- Identified functional and non-functional requirements
- Defined business rules and constraints

### 2. Conceptual Design
- Entity-Relationship Diagram development
- Relationship mapping (1:1, 1:Many, Many:Many)
- Business rules documentation

### 3. Logical Design
- Normalization process (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Schema definition with appropriate data types
- Constraint implementation

### 4. Physical Design
- Storage considerations and estimation
- Indexing strategy
- Performance optimization plan

## Key Design Decisions

### Normalization
- Implemented 3rd Normal Form to eliminate redundancy
- Used junction tables for many-to-many relationships
- Maintained referential integrity with foreign keys

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexing on frequently queried columns
- Materialized views for complex reports
- Query optimization for common operations

### Business Logic Implementation
- Stored procedures for core operations
- Triggers for automated data integrity
- Constraints for data validation
